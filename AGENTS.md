## Scope of Modification
- Do not modify anything unless explicitly instructed or requested by the author.

## Preserve Author’s Intent
- Maintain the original tone, structure, and wording style whenever possible.
- Only correct clear typos or objective errors.

## Record All Changes
- Document every modification along with the reason and the exact change made.

## Always Reflect the Latest File
- All updates must be based on the latest version currently stored in the repository.
- Previous conversation history should be considered as reference only, not the source of truth.
- If any previous statement conflicts with the current file, always prioritize the latest file.

## Language Preference
- Korean is the default language for responses unless the user requests otherwise.
- The same applies to the “Updated Plan” section.
- Technical terms or error messages may include English with appropriate Korean explanation when needed.
